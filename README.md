# Small Python-based game
This project is to learn how to use the pygame module.

## Point of game
There is no point, but you can collect as many threes as you like.  
Try to collect 100, 1000, maybe even 100 000.  
I don't really know how high the count goes, but i assume infinity

## My thoughts on pygame
Works fine to make mini-games,  
would rather use a Game Engine  
like Unity or Unreal Engine for large-scale games

## Upcoming features
- Sell threes
- Buy items
- character selection
- levels
- etc..
